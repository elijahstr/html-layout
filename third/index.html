                Consider hiding the status bar-and 
                all other app UI-while people are 
                actively viewing full-screen media. 
                If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people
                retrieve it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single
                tap.  Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, 
                avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status 
                bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture
                or to remember it.
